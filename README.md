# Urho Sample Platformer


--
14.4.2018 updated to trunk ( at this point: 218e4d7592cf8681001e795cac6672fb29fb156a ).
Fixed few things in source code, updated CMake files, CoreData, some Data files.

Visual Studio 2017 info (should work other cmake_* too (but didnt test)):

Create solution like this

 cmake_vs2017.bat Build -DURHO3D_HOME=your_urho3d_build_directory
 
ie if you have F:/CPP/Urho3D/  (from trunk), and you created (cmake created) F:/CPP/Urho3D/Build/  dir where  lib/, include/ etc are, then use

 cmake_vs2017.bat Build -DURHO3D_HOME=F:/CPP/Urho3D/Build

Then open Build/Urho-Sample-Platformer.sln

-m

This is the first Urho3D sample project developed for the Unofficial Urho wiki: http://urho3d.wikia.com/  
The USP page there with Urho related details is at: http://urho3d.wikia.com/wiki/USP_-_Urho_Sample_Platformer  
See the wiki here https://github.com/gawag/Urho-Sample-Platformer/wiki for more game related informations.

## Build Instructions

Like Urho USP  uses CMake for building. I'm using Codeblocks on Windows but I also heard USP being build on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.  
See http://urho3d.wikia.com/wiki/Creating_a_new_Urho3D_Project for details.
